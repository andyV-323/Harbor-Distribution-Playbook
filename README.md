This is a ReadMe file for the project "# Harbor-Distribution-Playbook Project".

## Description

This is a Dynamic website I created for Harbor Distribution LLC.Created client-side web application utilizing HTML, CSS, Node.js, and Javascript to support dynamic content consumption and user engagement. Configured server-side architecture with Express and MySQL to handle CRUD operations with the database. Integrated version control with Git & enhanced scalability by deploying the application on the Heroku platform.

## Getting Started

## Dependencies 
In order to run this website locally on your machine you will need to install Node.js. You will also need a database in this case i used MySQLWorkbench.

## Installing 
Once you hava a database and node.js installed we will need to add some dependencies to our project. so first we need to make a directory for our project: mkdir nameOfYourProject

Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you created your project : cd nameOfYourProject.

Type npm init and hit enter. This will initiate a new Node.js project and create a package.json file. Follow the prompts to set up your project, such as setting the name, version, description, etc. Once the package.json file is created, you can start installing the necessary dependencies for your project. For example, if you need to use the Express.js framework, you can install it by typing npm install express in the command prompt. a nice tool to use is nodemon so install it by typing npm install nodemon. Then we need to npm install mysql in order to connect to our database. Create a new file called app.js or index.js (depending on your preference) in the project directory. This will be the entry point for your Node.js application.

## Executing program 
To execute this program cd into nameOfYourProject then type nodemon index.js. you will see that connection to your database was successful message. Remember to change login credentials to match your mysql database.
